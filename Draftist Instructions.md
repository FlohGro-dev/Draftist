> Welcome to Draftist - an Action Group for Draft to integrate with Todoist. This might be the most advanced Action Group to use Drafts with Todoist so please read the instructions.

Draftist contains a big amount of Actions to integrate Drafts with Todoist.
It is divided into several sections:

- General Actions
- Create Tasks

**TODO:**??
- Import Tasks
- Create Projects
- modify Actions
- Switch labels

## Using Draftist

Since Draftist contains a lot of Actions and you may not need every single of them you may want to create your own `my Draftist` Action Group to only include the Actions you want. While you can duplicate / move the Actions you use to your own Action Group(s) I recommend to leave the Draftist Action Group untouched. This ensures a single point of truth and if I need to fix/maintain Actions in Draftist your own Actions will work afterwards. Instead create your own Action and use an `include Action` Step where you paste the name of the Action you want to use - you can then give it a (shorter) name than in the Draftist Action Group.
You can assign keyboard shortcuts to the Actions you created to make them easily accessible (none of the Actions in Draftist has a keyboard shortcut assigned to don't conflict with your assignments).

Please **never** rename the `Draftist` Action (If you do so, no other Action will work anymore).

## Action Descriptions

Every Draftist Action contains a short description about its purpose / what it does. Due to the big amount of Actions you can also read through all descriptions in the [Action Descriptions](https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/Draftist/blob/main/Action%20Descriptions.md) file.

## Customizing Actions

All Draftist Actions work out of the box with no needed configuration from you. Especially the more complex and powerful actions allow you to configure the behavior of them in the action steps. Read through the corresponding [Action Description](https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/Draftist/blob/main/Action%20Descriptions.md) to find instructions what and how you can configure the Action to your need.

## Support Development

Draftist is completely free to use for you. However if this Action Group is useful for you and supports your workflows you can give something back to support development.

You can choose the amount you want to donate on those platforms.
