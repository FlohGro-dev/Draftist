## General Actions

### Draftist Instructions

> This Action presents instructions on how to use the Draftist Action Group.

### Draftist

> This Action loads all relevant functions that Draftist provides. Every Draftist Action includes this Action.
If you want to make you're own Action based on Draftist functions simply include this Action at the beginning.

### Draftist Settings

> This Action allows changing the default settings of Draftist or restore the default settings based on the user selections.

### Update local Todoist data

> This Action forces an update of the locally stored Todoist data. Use this if you e.g. just created a new project / label that you want to use immediately. Updates will be performed after 24 hours by default - you can change this using the [Draftist Settings](#draftist-settings) action.
